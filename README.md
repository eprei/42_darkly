## Web Security Audit Project

This project is an introduction to web application security, focusing on identifying and exploiting common vulnerabilities.

### Project Overview

Audit a simple website for security vulnerabilities, learning about the OWASP Top 10 and common web application risks.

### Objectives

- Discover and exploit 14 different security breaches
- Understand the underlying causes of these vulnerabilities
- Learn how to fix and prevent these security issues

### Requirements

- Use of a virtual machine (i386)
- Web browser for accessing the vulnerable website

### Getting Started

1. Boot up the provided ISO in a virtual machine
2. Access the website using the IP address provided at the prompt
3. Explore the website and identify vulnerabilities

### Deliverables

For each identified vulnerability:

1. Create a folder named after the breach
2. Include a `flag` file with the validation flag
3. Include a `Ressources` folder with all files needed to reproduce the exploit

### Note

This project is for educational purposes only. Always obtain proper authorization before testing for vulnerabilities on any system you do not own or have explicit permission to test.
