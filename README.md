An educational web security audit project focused on discovering and understanding common web vulnerabilities.

## 🚨 Disclaimer

This project is part of the cybersecurity curriculum at 42 School. The code and documentation provided are for **educational purposes only**. The vulnerabilities discussed should never be exploited on systems without explicit authorization.

## 🎯 Project Overview

## 🔍 Key Features

- Complete coverage of various web security vulnerabilities
- Documentation of discovery, exploitation, and mitigation strategies
- Resource gathering and methodology documentation
- Custom scripts and tools for security testing

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Virtual Machine (i386)
- Basic understanding of web technologies
- Knowledge of common web security concepts

## 📋 Project Structure

```
└── [Vulnerability Category]/
    ├── flag

```

Each vulnerability is documented in its own directory, containing:
- A detailed explanation of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Mitigation strategies
- Resources for further learning

## ⚠️ Important Note

This repository contains solutions to a school project. If you're a 42 student, I encourage you to solve the challenges yourself first. The learning experience is much more valuable than simply looking at solutions.
